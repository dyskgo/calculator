# Calculator

This is my calculator project, created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. 

The functionality for the calculator was created using Javascript. 

The calculator does not use eval() to perform its functions, but it does adhere to BEDMAS. Meaning, if you input '5 + 5 / 5', the answer will be '6', not '2'.
